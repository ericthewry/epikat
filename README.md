# Epik -- Epistemic <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kat</span>

Epik is a modelling tool for representing the intensional semantics of natural
language sentences. Users specify valid world states, events that transition
between states, epistemic agents, and the inferences the agents make from the
worlds. Together these represent a space of possible worlds in which the user
can evaluate the logical forms of sentences. More information can be found in
our SCiL '21 paper.

_The Concealed Coin_ If there are two agents at a table `Amy` and `Bob` who are
curious about whether a concealed coin is heads-up or tails-up (lets say its
been flipped and covered with a sheet of paper befor either party could look at
the coin).
